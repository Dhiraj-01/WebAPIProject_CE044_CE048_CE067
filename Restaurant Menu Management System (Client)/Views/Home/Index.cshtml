    <h1>Restaurant Menu Management System (RMMS)</h1>
    <p>
        Your back-of-house team puts a ton of effort into crafting your dishes. Shouldn’t your POS system’s restaurant menu management software be just as carefully crafted?
    </p>
    <p>
        We think so. That’s why we designed the TouchBistro menu management system specifically for restaurant service staff, with a host of smart features to make your menu ordering, prep, and reporting process a masterpiece.

        Menu management software, sometimes called menu planning software, is any computer program that allows you to control your restaurant's menu and prices electronically.
